AWS DevOps Professional Exam Study Guide + Tips

**Please Note: This is not a full fledged Exam guide covering every single topic in its absolute length and breadth, It highlights and details the topics I found to be the most tricky and lowkey ominpresent in the exam.

**Exam Topics**

    [SDLC Automation] (./SDLC Automation.md)
    Configuration Management and IaC 
    Resilient Cloud Solutions 
    Monitoring and Logging 
    Incident and Event Response 
    Security and Compliance 

Tips 

1. Use practice tests, tests from Stephane marek and dojotutorials on udemy are quite close to the real deal, during the practice exams use tip No.2 to gauge your prerparation.

2. A good way to gauge your preparation is by your ability to filter out two options out of usually 4 choices, As the DevOps Professional exam usually has two very close choices to the original answer. If you are able to find these 2 quite quickly during your practice exams then thats a great sign about your preparedness. 

3. The exam is different from the SysOps/CloudOps examination as you will find most questions requiring knowledge of multiple domains from the Exam domains mentioned above. For example You will find a lot of Cloudformation questions built around CodePipeline. So, it is advisable to have a good base on all topics before starting up with the practice tests

4. Since the Exam Questions are mostly lengthy, a good way to cut short the reading time (and Exhaustion) is to look for the keywords like - 'Most efficient, Most resillient, Most Cost-effective, etc' this can help you atleast with narrowing down to two options, after which you can mentally compare them and see the key differences in them as those two remaining options will usually have only few key differences.
